(Testing)

This project applies Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to process images using quantum computing principles. The implementation utilizes Qiskit to encode, transform, and reconstruct images using a quantum circuit. The goal is to explore quantum image processing and investigate how quantum algorithms can be applied to classical image data.

Features

✅ Quantum State Encoding: Converts grayscale images into quantum states using amplitude encoding.

✅ Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT): Applies QFT on the encoded image to analyze frequency components.

✅ Quantum Measurement & Reconstruction: Captures quantum circuit outputs and reconstructs a visual representation.

✅ IBM Quantum Backend Support: Runs on IBM Quantum devices or Qiskit's Aer simulator.
